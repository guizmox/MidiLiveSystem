MIDI Live System for Windows

Requirements : 
- .Net Core 3.1.
- Windows 10
- A fairly solid AUDIO/MIDI configuration for low latency
- It works with software synths through virtual MIDI ports but I believe the latency could be a problem in case of an heavy routing. Best use case is with hardware synths

The software is mostly inspired by Vangelis System I that I improved with other cool stuff : 
Features : 
- Up to 20 "Routing Box" : a routing box is basically a MIDI IN/OUT box that can be programmed
- Up to 8 presets by Routing Box
- 32 step 4 channels sequencer with transposition
- Ability to "build the musical scene" by moving the boxes on a scene that will impact both Pan and Volume
- Can load Cubase Instrument files to easily browse and select any preset from your instruments
- MIDI translation : each box can translate MIDI messages (ie : aftertouch to note output) for crazy effects
- MIDI converters, filters
- "Smooth CC" that can help control your performance by smoothing out fast incoming CC switching
- "Delay" to delay a routing box output to give "space" to your performance
- Harmonizer options for realtime harmonization (adding notes to the already played ones)
- "Add Life" function that will randomize parameters in real-time to make your live performance more vibrant
- Midi Monitor : see what's happening in case of complex a complex routing
- Recall buttons : can be pushed (if you own a touchscreen) or recalled by a MIDI device to quickly change the whole performance configuration
- Record and Play your performances
- Save an Open projets
- ...more to come
